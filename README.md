# Flappy-bird AI using NEAT

An AI model that leans to play the game flappy bird using NEAT(NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies).
NEAT is an evolutionary algorithm that creates artificial neural networks and is very effective in creating models that learn to play games.

### Installation

Install Python 3.x +

Install the dependencies.

```sh
pip install pygame
pip install neat-python
```

To just play the game yourself run (there is no game ending for human players. mainly for debuging)...

```sh
python game.py
```

To start training a model...

```sh
python train.py
```
